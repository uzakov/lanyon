You can find below my bookshelf. It's divided into two sections: the books that have changed my perspective, taught me, affected my lifestyle and other books I recommend, that might not had such a big effect but nevertheless still interesting.

I've written a summary of things that summarise the key themes in these book. They are useful to help me remember the main points of each book.
