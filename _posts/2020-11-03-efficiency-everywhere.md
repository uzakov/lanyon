title: Efficiency everywhere: Finance

Working in the software engineering field one of the concepts we often speak about is efficiency. It would be no surprise to many that we can apply efficiency to our personal finance as well.

*Note: A big part of this article was written pre-Covid, my hope that this article can help people who can optimise their spendings be more effective and by no means written to hurt those who unfortunately can’t at the moment.*
This blogpost shares what you can do in terms of financial optimisation, money and finances in general. I am assuming a certain level of income, as it is impossible to optimise spendings if you can't afford to.

Opinions expressed here are mine alone, not those of any bank, credit card issuer, employer, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities. Please do your own research and take this on your own risk.

### Key optimisation tips:
- Get a credit card that offers a cashback (example of some that offer it <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/credit-cards/">https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/credit-cards/</a>), try to use this card for all your spendings, you get around 1% cashback as well as sign-up bonus in many cases (some offer £100-250 worth of sign up bonus in points). One of the risks with credit cards is that the interest rate on some is very high, some are 75%! Do make sure to read Terms and Conditions
- Use current account switch bonuses regularly (at the moment of writing NatWest offers £125 for new account switching).
- Do use websites like <a href="https://www.hotukdeals.com/">hotukdeals</a>  and <a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/">https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/</a>  and cashback websites when shopping online. Hotukdeals shows your discounts on products and CamelCamelCamel shows price history for Amazon products. One feature I like on camelcamelcamel is "Alerts", if you are happy to wait for a particular item to drop in price you can set up a price alert and get a notification when it becomes a certain price.
- Cashback websites - they will give you a nice cashback in many cases, make sure to shop around
- Make your own coffee! Seriously, you save so much money and I bet your coffee will be better quality too! Should have learned this earlier. Invest into equipment and it will pay off in 2-3 month. I personally have a Bialetti Mokka pot and Hario Mill Mini Plus. https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/
- Do open and use an ISA (Individual Savings Accounts) https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts
- Switch your providers regularly - internet, gas, electricity. You often get good deals and bonuses.
- Mix and match shopping - if possible buy from different shopping chains, ie meat from a more premium supermarket while everything from discount ones. Make sure to do a comparison between more and less expensive supermarkets, for example "Tesco vs Aldi vs Waitrose(surprise!)". When doing personal calculations and taking into account certain peculiarity of each one of them (For example Waitrose does free delivery over certain amount, will often substitute items for items for the higher amount/price(for free) if selected item isn't available, give items for free if they have a short end date) I found that for me in particular online grocery shopping with Waitrose is 5-10% more expensive compared to Tesco/Sainsburys, while I prefer the taste of Waitrose food much more. Aldi/Lidl is generally cheaper compared to other retailers but they are not available everywhere and you generally need a car to get to them, which makes it more difficult for many.
