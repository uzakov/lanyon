Last week was full of interesting cyber security meetups in London.
I attended two, one hosted at Capital One office and another one hosted by OWASP at Revolut office.

### Cyber London, hosted by Capital One

On the 17th of July Georg(my colleague) and I attended a cybersecurity event after work, hosted and organized by Capital One.

There were two talks:

1. Hostage Negotiation, Cyber Extortion, Critical Incident Handling and You!
2. Browser Security Basics


#### Hostage Negotiation, Cyber Extortion, Critical Incident Handling and You!

“To Pay or Not To Pay used to be the question, now, Are You Ready to Negotiate?” That was one of the themes of the talk. Two presenters had extensive experience in hostage negotiation and fighting organized crime. One is formerly the Team Leader of Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) International Negotiation Team, graduate of both the FBI’s and Scotland Yard’s Hostage Negotiation Programs. Another formerly a United Nations senior security official. They shared their experience and knowledge of organized crime. Even though they do not deal with cybercrime directly, a lot of their methods are also applicable to IT. Do not pay the ransomware creators.

#### Browser Security Basics

The most interesting talk from the engineering perspective, where we had a chance to hear from Mark Goodwin, Mozilla engineer who is working on the Firefox web browser.

Mark covered the basics of browser security, what it does and why it’s important. He also covered the use of Rust at Mozilla, why it’s a great language from a security point of view(memory and thread safety) and plans to increase the amount of Rust code in Firefox.
