  I'm an engineer at Zoopla, where I help design, build and secure the future of prop tech.

I am a strong believer of "human" AppSec, where helping, influencing developers mindset by providing resources, guidance, interesting and hands-on training goes a long way. Great products are built through cooperation, openness, bringing modern practises. Too often security people try to approach security only from the policy, bureaucratic side or even force it, without understanding the underlying reasons why things were done a particular way. AppSec should not be the roadblocker but rather teammate, internal consultant.

I have background in Computer Science and Mathematics and especially enjoy projects that use graph theory.

I started this website while studying at university and it has been evolving since. This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.
Design is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

My favourite TV show is Scrubs. My favourite book is Hard to be a God by Arkady Strugatsky and Boris Strugatsky.
