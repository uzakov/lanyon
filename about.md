  Hi! I'm Alikhan Uzakov. I grew up in Almaty, and moved to study to the United Kingdom in 2011. Iâ€™m currently an Application Security Engineer at Zoopla, where I help design, build and secure the future of prop tech. Previously I worked at Clearswift, PwC.

I am a strong believer of "human" AppSec, where helping and influencing developers' mindset by providing resources, guidance, interesting and hands-on training goes a long way. Great products are built through cooperation, openness and bringing modern practises to the table. Too often security people try to approach security only from the policy, bureaucratic side or even force it, without understanding the underlying reasons why things were done a particular way. AppSec should not be the roadblocker but rather your teammate, or an internal consultant.
